        <h3>Thanks For Being A Friend</h3>
        <p>This game was created during Brain Jam 2015, a 48-hour game jam focusing on mental health put on by the Brooklyn Gamery. For this project, I taught myself the basics of Phaser.io, a 2D JavaScript/HTML5 game framework. The game itself focuses on cheering up a futuristic Golden Girl character by "attacking" them with cheerful images.</p>

        <h3>Bomb Defuser</h3>
        <p>This simple bomb defusion simulation game was originally a prompt I developed to teach my students about DOM manipulation and event listeners. I created the graphics, HTML, and CSS - their mission was to write the JavaScript that would enable their user to disarm the bomb and save the world!</p>

        <h3>Attendance Tracker</h3>
        <p>While working as an instructor, I got tired of using spreadsheets to track my students' attendance. As a side project, I created a Rails/Backbone web application with Github login to help me track and import student information, class information, and attendance more easily.</p>
