        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm a <strong>full-stack web developer</strong> with experience building applications in <strong>Rails</strong>, <strong>Node</strong> &amp; <strong>Express</strong>. I work on <strong>Linux</strong> &amp; <strong>Mac</strong> machines, am a super huge nerd for education &amp; games, and have lived in NYC for nearly a decade.</p>
        <p>Ever since I can remember, I've been tinkering with code. Last year I jumped in headfirst and began programming in earnest. I'm currently teaching the basics of web development in <strong>Ruby</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> to novice programmers and designing educational materials that keep folks excited about code.</p>

            <h3>Thanks For Being A Friend</h3>
          </a>
          <p>This game was created during <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brainjam">Brain Jam 2015</a>, a 48-hour game jam focusing on mental health put on by the Brooklyn Gamery. For this project, I taught myself the basics of Phaser.io, a 2D JavaScript/HTML5 game framework. The game itself focuses on cheering up a futuristic Golden Girl character by "attacking" them with cheerful images.</p>

          </a>
          <p>This simple bomb defusion simulation game was originally <a href="https://github.com/annarankin/bomb_defusion">a prompt I developed</a> to teach my students about DOM manipulation and event listeners. I created the graphics, HTML, and CSS - their mission was to write the JavaScript that would enable their user to disarm the bomb and save the world!</p>

          <h3>Attendance Tracker</h3>
          <p>While working as an instructor, I got tired of using spreadsheets to track my students' attendance. As a side project, I created a Rails/Backbone web application with Github login to help me track and import student information, class information, and attendance more easily.</p>
